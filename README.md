AnimationChecker
================

Upload your spritesheet and set the number of frames and then click the button to see how smooth is your sprite animation

Check out the demo at www.azukisoft.com/OSC/

You can also key in the frame number so that you can play the animation according to the frame sequence that you define

===DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS===
Just copy the files over to a directory and voila, it is up and running. Images are stored as flat files with no need for any DB fiddling
